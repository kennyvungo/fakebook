* Background 

Fakebook is a fullstack clone of the social media website Fakebook. The goal of this project was to be as realistic and as close as possible to the functionality of the real Facebook.

In this current implementation of Fakebook, a user is able to create an account, login, and CRUD functionality for post, comments, friends, and likes. Users are also able to upload photos for account profile pictures, cover photos, and posts photos. All of these changes will persist across any account that is logged in. THe current data in the site was created using a seed file.

* Libraries and Methods 

The backend of this project was set up using Ruby on Rails, while the frontend was accomplished using React, React Redux, and ReactRouter version 5; project dependencies were handled with npm. The live version of this project is hosted through Render and store images on AWS S3.
